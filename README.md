[Django Project Builder](http://builtbyptm.com/blog/announcing-django-project-builder-v01/ "Announcing Django Project Builder v0.1")
======================

## Intro

Django Project Builder is the fastest, easiest way to, well... build a
new Django project!


## Features and Benefits

* Create a new Django project, git repo, virtualenv, and Django app
  with sane defaults _all_ with a single command

* Prepare your server for deployment with a couple more commands

* Auto-deploy your shiny new Django app to your server with a simple
  `git push`!  (Uses git hooks behind the scenes... but you don't need
  to worry about that, do you?)

* Two Front-end options, both with CSS Stylesheets and HTML Templates with a lot of swag.


## What you don't have to dread anymore

* Tediously editing config files before anything works, even though
  you use the same defaults every single time

* Being forced to copy/paste/edit the same content over and over from
  old `settings.py` files

* Spending too much time configurationating, and not enough time
  coding


## Who is DPB for?

Django programmers using a Unix-based OS looking to do more coding and less config.

For those looking to enjoy convenient server deployments, note that
the __server scripts__ currently assume you're using Bash + virtualenv +
virtualenvwrapper + Ubuntu + Apache.  We're working on reducing the
number of dependencies.

[See our TODO](https://github.com/prototypemagic/django-projectbuilder/blob/master/TODO.md)
for what's on the horizon, and for what you may want to help out with.


## So... how do I use it?

### Dev Box Usage

After cloning this repo to your local machine, `cd` into it and run
something like

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project

to create the `~/new_project_site` directory, which contains _tons_ of
Django boilerplate -- common imports, virtualenv creation, a new git
repo, and more!

If you add the optional `--bootstrap` argument, your project will be created
using all Bootstrap defaults for the front-end.

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project --bootstrap

If you add the optional `--foundation` argument, your project will be created
using all Foundation 3 defaults for the front-end.

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project --foundation

`virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` are required. `git` is
recommended. Django is awesome.


### Server Usage

After cloning this repo to one of your many servers, `cd` into it and
run

    bash gitbuilder.sh ~/new_project

to create the top-level project directory, bare git repo, and empty
${PROJECT_NAME}_site directory for the soon-to-exist Django project.
Follow the instructions echoed to the screen, which include using
`apachebuilder.sh` to generate your project's Apache config.

Enjoy!


## Troubleshooting

### Postgres

On Ubuntu, install Postgres with

    sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-all

To install `psycopg2`, Django's Postgres driver, run

    pip install psycopg2

If you get the following error when trying to install `psycopg2`

    ./psycopg/psycopg.h:30:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.
    error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

that means you haven't installed all the necessary header (*.h) files
to compile additional Python modules/Django apps.  On Ubuntu, run

    sudo apt-get install python-dev

to fix this issue, then again try running

    pip install psycopg2

from within your project's virtualenv to install `psycopg2`.


#### Postgres + Heroku

Heroku requires that you use Postgres as your database.  To install
Postgres, run

    pip install psycopg2

then add `psycopg2` and every other Python module and Django app in
your virtualenv to `requirements.txt` with

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

You'll now want to add `requirements.txt` to your git repo, then
redeploy with

    git add requirements.txt
    git commit -m "Updated requirements.txt"
    git push heroku master

with more on deploying to Heroku.
